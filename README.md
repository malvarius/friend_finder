This website was a friend-finder built to see based on a small survey what friends you match with!

By default there are three dogs you can match with but as people take the survey you will be able to match with people too!

As you complete the survey please remember to only hit the submite button once! After that please hit the see match button to see your match!

**Technologies used: Node.js , Express, Bootstrap**

Fill out the information as it suits your personality:
