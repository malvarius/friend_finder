# friend_finder

Here is a link to the deployed website!
https://frozen-headland-66214.herokuapp.com



This website was a friend-finder built to see based on a small survey what friends you match with!

By default there are three dogs you can match with but as people take the survey you will be able to match with people too!

As you complete the survey please remember to only hit the submite button once! After that please hit the see match button to see your match!


To run the code yourself, please just copy the repository, run npm install, and you can run it using node on the default port : 3000.
